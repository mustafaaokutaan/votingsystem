# <a name="description"></a> Description #
This console application is a Python-based prototype designed to simulate a voting system. Users can cast votes for their preferred candidates, and the program keeps track of the total votes for each. After every vote, it calculates and displays the percentage of votes each candidate has received. The goal of this project is to offer a potential digital solution for election processes, which could be particularly beneficial for countries that encounter difficulties with traditional, manual voting methods.
