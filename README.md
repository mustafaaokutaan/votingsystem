This is a simple console application built to simulate a voting system using Python. The program allows the user to select a candidate, calculates the number of votes for each candidate, and displays the percentage of votes for each candidate after each vote. The aim of the project is to provide a prototype solution to digitalize elections, which could be useful for countries facing challenges in conducting manual elections.
