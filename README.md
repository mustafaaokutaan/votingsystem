SimpleVotingSystem
This is a simple console application built to simulate a voting system. The program prompts the user to choose a candidate, calculates the number of votes for each candidate, and displays the percentage of votes for each candidate after each vote. The project's goal is to offer a prototype to digitalize elections, which could be a good example for countries that face challenges in maintaining their elections manually.

Features
User Input: Users can select a candidate by entering a choice in the console.
Vote Calculation: The application tracks the number of votes for each candidate.
Real-time Percentages: After each vote, the program calculates and displays the percentage of votes each candidate has received.
Console Application: A simple, interactive command-line interface for a quick and easy experience.
Installation for Python
To run the Python version of this project, make sure Python is installed on your system. You can use any code editor or run the script in the terminal. Simply copy the Python code into a file named simple_voting_system.py and execute it using the command python simple_voting_system.py.
